# Terraform Lab

Now that you've going through the [guided example](example-terraform.md),
you're ready to put your Terraform knowledge to use.

Add the following config to your Terraform plan.  As Terraform concatenates
all Terraform files together, you can either place additional config in
new files within the same directory or put everyting in the same file, it
doesn't matter:

* the following address object:
  ![Wordpress Server address object](../pics/wordpress.png)
  
  [solution](ao-terraform.md)
* the following security rules:
  ![security policy](../pics/security-policy.png)
  
  **Note**:  there are multiple resources you can use to accomplish this,
  feel free to use whichever resource you want to use.
